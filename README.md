A Taste of Programming (for Kids) Flowchart

Go here for a write-up that explains the different decision points:

About the flowchart:
* It's opiniated.
 The focus is on giving good advice. The flowchart doesn't attempt to include all possible learning paths,
 or even most of them. Instead, it tries to pick the best representative examples of different categories.
 These are technologies and toys I've tried myself.
* It's a "taste" of programming.
 Its aim is to get you started. It doesn’t try to guide you through a required progression of skills to
 become a programmer.
* Activities have a mix of complexity levels and time requirements.
 You'll be able to tell which activities are more relaxed and which are more challenging. But you might not
 know how much a child will get out of a particular activity--and that's perfectly fine! There's no wasted
 time when you’re learning something new.
  
 If you've tried something that you're passionate about and you think should be in the flowchart, please let
